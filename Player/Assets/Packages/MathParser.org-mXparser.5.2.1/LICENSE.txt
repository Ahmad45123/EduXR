ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION ON WORKSTATION

The number of workstations does not relate to the final distribution of
your end-product to your end-users. In typical cases the number of
workstations is a way to measure the scale of the process of design
and/or development and/or creation and/or manufacturing of your product.

A workstation is a device, a remote device, or a virtual device, used by
you, your employees, or other entities to whom you have commissioned the
tasks. For example, the number of workstations may refer to the number
of software developers, engineers, architects, scientists, and other
professionals who use the PRODUCT on your behalf. The number of
workstations is not the number of copies of your end-product that you
distribute to your end-users.

By purchasing the COMMERCIAL LICENSE, you only pay for the number of
workstations, while the number of copies/users of your final product
(delivered to your end-users) is not limited.

UPGRADE POLICY

The PRODUCT is versioned according to the following convention:

   [MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]

1. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders can install and use the updated version
   for bug fixes free of charge, i.e. if you have purchased a license
   for the [MAJOR].[MINOR] version (e.g.: 5.0), you can freely install
   all the various releases specified in the [PATCH] version (e.g.: 5.0.2).
   The license terms remain unchanged after the update.
2. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders for [MAJOR].[MINOR] version (e.g.: 5.0)
   can install and use the updated version [MAJOR].[MINOR + 1] free of
   charge, i.e., plus one release in the [MINOR] range (e.g.: 5.1). The
   license terms remain unchanged after the update.
3. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders who wish to upgrade their version, but are
   not eligible for the free upgrade, can claim a discount when
   purchasing the upgrade. For this purpose, please contact us via e-mail.
